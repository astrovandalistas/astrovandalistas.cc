Astrovandalistas is a translocal collective that focuses on the development of projects that combine research, artistic action, technology, activism, urban hacking and open knowledge.
 
Founded in Tijuana in 2010, the collective is based in Mexico City, but operates as a laboratory of decentralized action in different locations in Latin America and the United States.
 
Our strategy is to generate low budget technologies that can be easily replicated by people in different places. Our work is influenced by low-budget, DIY, DIWO cultures and the free software and open hardware movements.
 
Our actions are motivated by the research of interfaces for human-machine and human-human communication, the use of public space for creating individual and/or collective experiences, and the development of tools that enable new forms of collective communication mediated entirely by open technologies.
 
The members of Astrovandalistas have exhibited individual works in Mexico, Brazil, Germany, Spain, Canada and Chile in collaboration with Medialab-Prado, Marginalia+Lab, Hangar, Nuvem, SESC and Centro Multimedia Mexico.
