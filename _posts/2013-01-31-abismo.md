El Abismo was part live performance, and part construction of a collective memory of the events that took place during The Mexican Spring of 2012, built by those who participated in the manifestations.

People were invited to participate in the construction of a collective archive by submitting their images, videos, audio tracks and texts through an online platform. The material was then organized during a week-long workshop at the Live Performers Meeting 2013 in Mexico City, and the resulting archive was exhibited as a live performance during the same festival.

Documentation and the archive can be accessed on the projectâ€™s [website](http://astrovandalistas.cc/abismo/){:target="_blank"}.
