Part workshop, part collective documentation, part installation, part audiovisual collage, part occupation… La Sonora Telemática was a project that combined ideas from two previous projects to create a collective multimedia narrative about events related to the Maple Spring protests of 2012.

Along with participants of a 3-day workshop at the 2014 Sight+Sound Festival, we created a collective media archive, and then used this material to create narratives based on personal experiences and perspectives.

The result was a kind of media orchestra, where the archive was played by a variety of screens and megaphones, installed at the entrance of the gallery where the Sight+Sound Festival took place.
