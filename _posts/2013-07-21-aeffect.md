ÆffectLab is a local communication network in which human-human communication can develop and take place. It is a framework for promoting the creation of affective models of communication that are specific to a location, event or group of people.

Our first instance of the Lab was made up of 3 different physical prototypes based on our own experiences, and desires for human-human communication. Most of these were thought as technologies that could be deployed during protests or other forms of public manifestations.

Overall, it’s the start of a conversation about how we can use technology to ensure collective participation in certain social structures.
