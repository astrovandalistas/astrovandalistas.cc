The Arma Sonora Telemática is a device used to amplify and project people’s opinions onto a physical space. It is a tool for voicing the collective discontent over the role of violence in Mexico’s recent history.

In 2012 we turned a metallic structure in front of the Campo Marte military base in México City into a percussive sequencer using a motor and a system of strings and pulleys, which were activated every time someone used the hashtag #BANGCampoMarte on Twitter.

Documentation, photos and more information about the project can be seen on its [website](http://astrovandalistas.cc/ast/){:target="_blank"}.
