Inspired by the idea of a technological afterglow, An Argument for Technology hints at a future where not only we have become disillusioned with technology, but also superfluous in its operation. A future where weâ€™ve successfully been able to optimize ourselves out, and technology is capable of communicating with itself using the leftovers of our digital affections.

In this particular instance, a megaphone and a computer monitor discuss the aftermath of their relationship and existence using fatalistic texts scraped from search engines and social networking sites.
