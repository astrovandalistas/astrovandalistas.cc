This was a series of workshops and public interventions organized as part of the [Acciones Territoriales](http://accionesterritoriales.blogspot.mx/){:target="_blank"} exhibition, in which a group of artists, writers and activists collaborated to create a digital zine about the current state of telecommunications in Mexico and the telecommunication reform laws.

This digital zine was installed on a number of modified WiFi routers that were then deployed in public spaces like cafes, museums and markets, with an open network named “Free WiFi”. Upon accessing this network, users were automatically directed to the zine before realizing it was the only content on this network.

An online version of the zine can be seen [here](http://astrovandalistas.cc/accionesterritoriales/){:target="_blank"}.
