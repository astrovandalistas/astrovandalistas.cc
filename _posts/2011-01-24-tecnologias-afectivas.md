**Description**:  
Together with [Interfaces Desobedientes]({{ site.baseurl }}/interfaces-desobedientes/), this workshop tries to examine how commercial communication platforms can be re-appropriated and used for political action in public spaces.

During the workshop, participants learn how to program simple objects to react to different types of social media traffic. From a megaphone that shouts messages marked with a specific Twitter hashtag, to computer monitors that display poetry made up of words and images from Instagram streams.

**Duration**:  
4 x 5-hour days

**Keywords**:  
Linux, RaspberryPi, Python, Pygame, APIs

**Day 1**:  
Introduction to Linux and Python.

**Day 2**:  
More Python.

**Day 3**:  
How to scrape data from social networks.

**Day 4**:  
Output design and deployment.

**Participants**:  
No prior knowledge of programming or electronics is required. The only prerequisites are: an interest in experimental uses of technology, and patience.
